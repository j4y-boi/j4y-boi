## Hi! Hello!ðŸ‘‹
I go with j4y_boi online, where the name came from? I'm not sure anymore,   
but guess who's too lazy to change all of his socials? <sub>couldn't be me :P</sub>  

Some stuff about me:
- I'm currently in High School
- I mainly use Python, Lua and HTML.
- I'm located in Belgium, awesome place.

My pinned has some active projects, the others may just be random forks.  
**Currently focussing on studying tho :P**
